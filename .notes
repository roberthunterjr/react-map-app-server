MVP -

API endpoint that returns array of place_ids put in order of increasing distance

Ideas -

Use server to host api point for react application
Use google Distance matrix to find distances between each of the origins and the corresponding dataset that is in question

Will need to format places intersection to be used by the distance matrix calculation

Can possibly add dist_one and dist_two properties to each entry so that the data will be in one place

Can finally finish by using sort method that takes the data by the sum of the distances.


Issues -

Using 1 api call for each address to location lookup, 1 for each loc to places lookup,
and 1 for the distance matrix
total of 5 calls per request is being used.
Need to find way to optimize

Distance calculation does not take into account the displacment, which may actually
be greater than 10 miles in some cases

Need to reifne the results of search as well


Current Notes -

Currently implementing distance matrix to return rows containing distances for each
of the destination entries;
